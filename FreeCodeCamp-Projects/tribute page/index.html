        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam; (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015)
        was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of
        India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil
        Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next
        four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the
        Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space
        Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
        civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He
        thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
        development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology
