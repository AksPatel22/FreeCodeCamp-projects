              Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming
              language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further
              developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with
              an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers
              to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.

              Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and
              integrate systems more efficiently. There are two major Python
              versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different.

              In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can
              store data of different types, and different types can do
              different things. Python has the following data types built-in by
              default, in these categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Text Type: str</li>
              <li>Numeric Types: int,float,complex</li>
              <li>Sequence Types: list,tuple,range</li>
              <li>Mapping Types: dict</li>
              <li>Set Types: set,frozenset</li>
              <li>Boolean Type: bool</li>
              <li>Binary Types: bytes,bytearray,memoryview</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Python is not “statically typed”. We do not need to declare
              variables before using them or declare their type. A variable is
              created the moment we first assign a value to it. A variable is a
              name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage
              in a program.
            </p>
            <p>
              The value stored in a variable can be changed during program
              execution. A variable is only a name given to a memory location,
              all the operations done on the variable effects that memory
              location.
            </p>
            <p>
              A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore
              character. A variable name cannot start with a number. A variable
              name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores
              (A-z, 0-9, and _ ). Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name
              and NAME are three different variables). The reserved
              words(keywords) cannot be used naming the variable.

              The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it
              will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false
              it won’t. But what if we want to do something else if the
              condition is false. Here comes the else statement. We can use the
              else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when
              the condition is false.
            </p>
            <code
              >a = 200 b = 33 if b > a: print("b is greater than a") elif a ==
              b: print("a and b are equal") else: print("a is greater than
              b")</code

            <p>
              Python While Loop is used to execute a block of statements
              repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. And when the
              condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in
              the program is executed. While loop falls under the category of
              indefinite iteration. Indefinite iteration means that the number
              of times the loop is executed isn’t specified explicitly in
              advance.
            </p>
            <code> while expression: statement(s) </code>
            <p>
              Statements represent all the statements indented by the same
              number of character spaces after a programming construct are
              considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses
              indentation as its method of grouping statements.

              Python Functions is a block of related statements designed to
              perform a computational, logical, or evaluative task. The idea is
              to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a
              function so that instead of writing the same code again and again
              for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code
              contained in it over and over again.
